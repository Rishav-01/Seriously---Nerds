# Seriously---Nerds
This website was built in my first year in #define hackathon which was organized at BPIT. 

So, this website helps people to donate food to needy people or to let them volunteer in this work. 
In many functions and weddings, lots of food gets wasted and to minimise this, we decided to build this website.

People can fill a form in which they can fill that from where the food has to be taken and we can verfiy the person's / organization's name via any Identification Proof.

Tech Stack used -> HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB \n
