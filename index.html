                <h1><b><u>Food Wastage</u></b></h1>
                <p>Food waste or food loss is that which is left uneaten or discarded. Food loss is not only at the end
                    of the chain, but also at the beginning from the time of production, processing, retailing and
                    consumption.
                    According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, one-third of the total global food
                    production is wasted, costing the world economy about $750 billion. Annually, close to `31 million
                    (70-75%) of waste is dumped into open landfill sites. Globally, India currently ranks seventh in
                    terms of overall food wastageagricultural produce, poultry and milk.</p>

                <h3><b>Food Wastage Crisis in India</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Around 67 million tonnes of food is wasted in India every year which has been valued at around
                        `92,000 crores; enough to feed all of Bihar
                        for a year</li>
                    <li>Annually, close to 21 million metric tonnes of wheat rots in India; a figure that is equal to
                        Australia's total annual production</li>
                    <li>According to the BMC, Mumbai generates close to 9,400 metric tonnes of solid waste per day, from
                        which 73% is food, vegetable, and fruit waste, while only 3% is plastic. The garbage dumps in
                        Mumbai are as tall as five or six storey buildings</li>
                    <li>Delhi generates around 9000 metric tonnes of waste per day, with the countryâ€™s largest landfill
                        located in East Delhi. This landfill is 70 acres vast and contains close to 12 million tonnes of
                        waste that are as high as 50 feet.</li>
